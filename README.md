Building a Peer to Peer system

The P2PSystem directory has the Task1, Task2 and TestingScenario directories.
rfc1-6 contain the split RFCs that we copied into the Task2/rfc directories of each peer.
Task2 has the latest updated code, under the src directory. 

Peers can be run using the shell scripts peerA.sh through peerF.sh
Registration server can be run using python reg_server.py

Similarly, code can be run in the Task1 and TestingScenario directories.
