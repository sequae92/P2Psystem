                          IS-IS Multi-Instance

Abstract

   This document describes a mechanism that allows a single router to
   share one or more circuits among multiple Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System (IS-IS) routing protocol instances.

   Multiple instances allow the isolation of resources associated with
   each instance.  Routers will form instance-specific adjacencies.
   Each instance can support multiple topologies.  Each topology has a
   unique Link State Database (LSDB).  Each Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
   will contain a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) identifying the instance
   and the topology (or topologies) to which the PDU belongs.

   This document obsoletes RFC 6822.
