    IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination Option

Abstract

   To assess performance problems, this document describes optional
   headers embedded in each packet that provide sequence numbers and
   timing information as a basis for measurements.  Such measurements
   may be interpreted in real time or after the fact.  This document
   specifies the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics (PDM) Destination
   Options header.  The field limits, calculations, and usage in
   measurement of PDM are included in this document.
