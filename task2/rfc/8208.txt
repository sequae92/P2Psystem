         BGPsec Algorithms, Key Formats, and Signature Formats

Abstract

   This document specifies the algorithms, algorithm parameters,
   asymmetric key formats, asymmetric key sizes, and signature formats
   used in BGPsec (Border Gateway Protocol Security).  This document
   updates RFC 7935 ("The Profile for Algorithms and Key Sizes for Use
   in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure").

   This document also includes example BGPsec UPDATE messages as well as
   the private keys used to generate the messages and the certificates
   necessary to validate those signatures.
