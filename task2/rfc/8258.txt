                 Generalized SCSI: A Generic Structure
          for Interface Switching Capability Descriptor (ISCD)
            Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI)

Abstract

   This document defines a generic information structure for information
   carried in routing protocol Interface Switching Capability Descriptor
   (ISCD) Switching Capability Specific Information (SCSI) fields.  This
   "Generalized SCSI" can be used with routing protocols that define
   GMPLS ISCDs and any specific technology.  This document does not
   modify any existing technology-specific formats and is defined for
   use in conjunction with new GMPLS Switching Capability types.  The
   context for this document is Generalized MPLS, and the reader is
   expected to be familiar with the GMPLS architecture and associated
   protocol standards.
