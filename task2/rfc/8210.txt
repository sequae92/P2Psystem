   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol,
                               Version 1

Abstract

   In order to verifiably validate the origin Autonomous Systems and
   Autonomous System Paths of BGP announcements, routers need a simple
   but reliable mechanism to receive Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   (RFC 6480) prefix origin data and router keys from a trusted cache.
   This document describes a protocol to deliver them.

   This document describes version 1 of the RPKI-Router protocol.  RFC
   6810 describes version 0.  This document updates RFC 6810.
