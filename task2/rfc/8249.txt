         Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL):
                            MTU Negotiation

Abstract

   The base IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol has a TRILL campus-wide MTU feature, specified in RFCs 6325
   and 7177, that assures that link-state changes can be successfully
   flooded throughout the campus while being able to take advantage of a
   campus-wide capability to support jumbo packets.  This document
   specifies recommended updates to that MTU feature to take advantage,
   for appropriate link-local packets, of link-local MTUs that exceed
   the TRILL campus MTU.  In addition, it specifies an efficient
   algorithm for local MTU testing.  This document updates RFCs 6325,
   7177, and 7780.
