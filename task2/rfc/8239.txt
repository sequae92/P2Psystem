                  Data Center Benchmarking Methodology

Abstract

   The purpose of this informational document is to establish test and
   evaluation methodology and measurement techniques for physical
   network equipment in the data center.  RFC 8238 is a prerequisite for
   this document, as it contains terminology that is considered
   normative.  Many of these terms and methods may be applicable beyond
   the scope of this document as the technologies originally applied in
   the data center are deployed elsewhere.
