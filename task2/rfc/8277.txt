           Using BGP to Bind MPLS Labels to Address Prefixes

Abstract

   This document specifies a set of procedures for using BGP to
   advertise that a specified router has bound a specified MPLS label
   (or a specified sequence of MPLS labels organized as a contiguous
   part of a label stack) to a specified address prefix.  This can be
   done by sending a BGP UPDATE message whose Network Layer Reachability
   Information field contains both the prefix and the MPLS label(s) and
   whose Next Hop field identifies the node at which said prefix is
   bound to said label(s).  This document obsoletes RFC 3107.
