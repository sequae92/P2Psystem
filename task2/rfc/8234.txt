    Updates to MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection in
               Automatic Protection Switching (APS) Mode

Abstract

   This document contains updates to MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP)
   linear protection in Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode
   defined in RFC 7271.  The updates provide rules related to the
   initialization of the Protection State Coordination (PSC) Control
   Logic (in which the state machine resides) when operating in APS mode
   and clarify the operation related to state transition table lookup.
