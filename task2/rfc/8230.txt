                       Using RSA Algorithms with
           CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) Messages

Abstract

   The CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) specification defines
   cryptographic message encodings using Concise Binary Object
   Representation (CBOR).  This specification defines algorithm
   encodings and representations enabling RSA algorithms to be used for
   COSE messages.  Encodings are specified for the use of RSA
   Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS) signatures, RSA
   Encryption Scheme - Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (RSAES-
   OAEP) encryption, and RSA keys.
