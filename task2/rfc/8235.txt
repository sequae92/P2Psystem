              Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof

Abstract

   This document describes the Schnorr non-interactive zero-knowledge
   (NIZK) proof, a non-interactive variant of the three-pass Schnorr
   identification scheme.  The Schnorr NIZK proof allows one to prove
   the knowledge of a discrete logarithm without leaking any information
   about its value.  It can serve as a useful building block for many
   cryptographic protocols to ensure that participants follow the
   protocol specification honestly.  This document specifies the Schnorr
   NIZK proof in both the finite field and the elliptic curve settings.
