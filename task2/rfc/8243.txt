                      Alternatives for Multilevel
          Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)

Abstract

   Although TRILL is based on IS-IS, which supports multilevel unicast
   routing, extending TRILL to multiple levels has challenges that are
   not addressed by the already-existing capabilities of IS-IS.  One
   issue is with the handling of multi-destination packet distribution
   trees.  Other issues are with TRILL switch nicknames.  How are such
   nicknames allocated across a multilevel TRILL network?  Do nicknames
   need to be unique across an entire multilevel TRILL network?  Or can
   they merely be unique within each multilevel area?
