 Preparation, Enforcement, and Comparison of Internationalized Strings
                  Representing Usernames and Passwords

Abstract

   This document describes updated methods for handling Unicode strings
   representing usernames and passwords.  The previous approach was
   known as SASLprep (RFC 4013) and was based on Stringprep (RFC 3454).
   The methods specified in this document provide a more sustainable
   approach to the handling of internationalized usernames and
   passwords.  This document obsoletes RFC 7613.
