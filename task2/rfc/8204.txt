   Benchmarking Virtual Switches in the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV)

Abstract

   This memo describes the contributions of the Open Platform for NFV
   (OPNFV) project on Virtual Switch Performance (VSPERF), particularly
   in the areas of test setups and configuration parameters for the
   system under test.  This project has extended the current and
   completed work of the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group in the
   IETF and references existing literature.  The Benchmarking
   Methodology Working Group has traditionally conducted laboratory
   characterization of dedicated physical implementations of
   internetworking functions.  Therefore, this memo describes the
   additional considerations when virtual switches are implemented on
   general-purpose hardware.  The expanded tests and benchmarks are also
   influenced by the OPNFV mission to support virtualization of the
   "telco" infrastructure.
