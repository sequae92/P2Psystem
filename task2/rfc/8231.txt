         Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
                      Extensions for Stateful PCE

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides
   mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path
   computations in response to Path Computation Client (PCC) requests.

   Although PCEP explicitly makes no assumptions regarding the
   information available to the PCE, it also makes no provisions for PCE
   control of timing and sequence of path computations within and across
   PCEP sessions.  This document describes a set of extensions to PCEP
   to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths
   (LSPs) via PCEP.
