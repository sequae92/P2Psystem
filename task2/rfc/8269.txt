                  The ARIA Algorithm and Its Use with
             the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)

Abstract

   This document defines the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm
   within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).  It details
   two modes of operation (CTR and GCM) and the SRTP key derivation
   functions for ARIA.  Additionally, this document defines DTLS-SRTP
   protection profiles and Multimedia Internet KEYing (MIKEY) parameter
   sets for use with ARIA.
