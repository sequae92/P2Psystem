                     BGPsec Protocol Specification

Abstract

   This document describes BGPsec, an extension to the Border Gateway
   Protocol (BGP) that provides security for the path of Autonomous
   Systems (ASes) through which a BGP UPDATE message passes.  BGPsec is
   implemented via an optional non-transitive BGP path attribute that
   carries digital signatures produced by each AS that propagates the
   UPDATE message.  The digital signatures provide confidence that every
   AS on the path of ASes listed in the UPDATE message has explicitly
   authorized the advertisement of the route.
