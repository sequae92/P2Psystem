                     Application-Aware Targeted LDP

Abstract

   Recent Targeted Label Distribution Protocol (tLDP) applications, such
   as remote Loop-Free Alternates (LFAs) and BGP auto-discovered
   pseudowires, may automatically establish a tLDP session with any
   Label Switching Router (LSR) in a network.  The initiating LSR has
   information about the targeted applications to administratively
   control initiation of the session.  However, the responding LSR has
   no such information to control acceptance of this session.  This
   document defines a mechanism to advertise and negotiate the Targeted
   Application Capability (TAC) during LDP session initialization.  As
