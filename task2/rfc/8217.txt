Clarifications for When to Use the name-addr Production in SIP Messages

Abstract

   RFC 3261 constrained several SIP header fields whose grammar contains
   the "name-addr / addr-spec" alternative to use name-addr when certain
   characters appear.  Unfortunately, it expressed the constraints with
   prose copied into each header field definition, and at least one
   header field was missed.  Further, the constraint has not been copied
   into documents defining extension headers whose grammar contains the
   alternative.

   This document updates RFC 3261 to state the constraint generically
   and clarifies that the constraint applies to all SIP header fields
   where there is a choice between using name-addr or addr-spec.  It
   also updates the RFCs that define extension SIP header fields using
   the alternative to clarify that the constraint applies (RFCs 3325,
   3515, 3892, 4508, 5002, 5318, 5360, and 5502).
