     Uniform Resource Name (URN) Namespace Registration Transition

Abstract

   The original registration procedure for formal Uniform Resource Name
   (URN) namespaces required IETF Consensus.  That requirement
   discouraged some registrations and increased the risk for problems
   that could occur as a result.  The requirements have now been changed
   by RFC 8141, which adopts a different model, focusing on encouraging
   registration and publication of information for all appropriate
   namespaces.  This document clarifies the status of relevant older
   RFCs and confirms and documents advice to IANA about selected
   existing registrations.  This document also obsoletes RFCs 3044 and
   3187 and moves them to Historic status.  These RFCs describe the ISSN
   and ISBN namespaces, which are now outdated because the descriptions
   reside in registration templates.
