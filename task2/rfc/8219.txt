       Benchmarking Methodology for IPv6 Transition Technologies

Abstract

   Benchmarking methodologies that address the performance of network
   interconnect devices that are IPv4- or IPv6-capable exist, but the
   IPv6 transition technologies are outside of their scope.  This
   document provides complementary guidelines for evaluating the
   performance of IPv6 transition technologies.  More specifically, this
   document targets IPv6 transition technologies that employ
   encapsulation or translation mechanisms, as dual-stack nodes can be
   tested using the recommendations of RFCs 2544 and 5180.  The
   methodology also includes a metric for benchmarking load scalability.
