           Selecting Labels for Use with Conventional DNS and
        Other Resolution Systems in DNS-Based Service Discovery

Abstract

   Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) can use naming
   systems other than DNS when looking for services.  Moreover, when it
   uses DNS, DNS-SD uses the full capability of DNS, rather than using a
   subset of available octets.  This is of particular relevance where
   some environments use DNS labels that conform to Internationalized
   Domain Names for Applications (IDNA), and other environments use
   labels containing Unicode characters (such as containing octets
   corresponding to characters encoded as UTF-8).  In order for DNS-SD
   to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name
   systems and conventions for their operation are in use, it is
   important to attend to differences in the underlying technology and
   operational environment.  This memo presents an outline of the
   requirements for the selection of labels for conventional DNS and
   other resolution systems when they are expected to interoperate in
   this manner.
