                      Multipath Extension for the
        Optimized Link State Routing Protocol Version 2 (OLSRv2)

Abstract

   This document specifies a multipath extension for the Optimized Link
   State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2) to discover multiple
   disjoint paths for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs).  Considering the
   characteristics of MANETs, especially the dynamic network topology,
   using multiple paths can increase aggregated throughput and improve
   the reliability by avoiding single route failures.  The
   interoperability with OLSRv2 is retained.
