          Virtual Private Wire Service Support in Ethernet VPN

Abstract

   This document describes how Ethernet VPN (EVPN) can be used to
   support the Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) in MPLS/IP networks.
   EVPN accomplishes the following for VPWS: provides Single-Active as
   well as All-Active multihoming with flow-based load-balancing,
   eliminates the need for Pseudowire (PW) signaling, and provides fast
   protection convergence upon node or link failure.
