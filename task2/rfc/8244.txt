               Special-Use Domain Names Problem Statement

Abstract

   The policy defined in RFC 6761 for IANA registrations in the
   "Special-Use Domain Names" registry has been shown, through
   experience, to present challenges that were not anticipated when RFC
   6761 was written.  This memo presents a list, intended to be
   comprehensive, of the problems that have since been identified.  In
   addition, it reviews the history of domain names and summarizes
   current IETF publications and some publications from other
   organizations relating to Special-Use Domain Names.

   This document should be considered required reading for IETF
   participants who wish to express an informed opinion on the topic of
   Special-Use Domain Names.
