       PCEPS: Usage of TLS to Provide a Secure Transport for the
         Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)

Abstract

   The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) defines
   the mechanisms for the communication between a Path Computation
   Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or among PCEs.
   This document describes PCEPS -- the usage of Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) to provide a secure transport for PCEP.  The
   additional security mechanisms are provided by the transport protocol
   supporting PCEP; therefore, they do not affect the flexibility and
   extensibility of PCEP.

   This document updates RFC 5440 in regards to the PCEP initialization
   phase procedures.
