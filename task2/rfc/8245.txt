                  Rules for Designing Protocols Using
          the Generalized Packet/Message Format from RFC 5444

Abstract

   RFC 5444 specifies a generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)
   packet/message format and describes an intended use for multiplexed
   MANET routing protocol messages; this use is mandated by RFC 5498
   when using the MANET port or protocol number that it specifies.  This
   document updates RFC 5444 by providing rules and recommendations for
   how the multiplexer operates and how protocols can use the
   packet/message format.  In particular, the mandatory rules prohibit a
   number of uses that have been suggested in various proposals and that
   would have led to interoperability problems, to the impediment of
   protocol extension development, and/or to an inability to use
   optional generic parse
