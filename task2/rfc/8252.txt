                       OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps

Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from native apps should only be made
   through external user-agents, primarily the user's browser.  This
   specification details the security and usability reasons why this is
   the case and how native apps and authorization servers can implement
   this best practice.
