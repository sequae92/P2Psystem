Abstract

   This document defines the 'multipart/multilingual' content type,
   which is an addition to the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
   (MIME) standard.  This content type makes it possible to send one
   message that contains multiple language versions of the same
   information.  The translations would be identified by a language tag
   and selected by the email client based on a user's language settings.
