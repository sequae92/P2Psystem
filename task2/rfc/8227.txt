   MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) Mechanism for Ring Topology

Abstract

   This document describes requirements, architecture, and solutions for
   MPLS-TP Shared-Ring Protection (MSRP) in a ring topology for point-
   to-point (P2P) services.  The MSRP mechanism is described to meet the
   ring protection requirements as described in RFC 5654.  This document
   defines the Ring Protection Switching (RPS) protocol that is used to
   coordinate the protection behavior of the nodes on an MPLS ring.
