    Data Center TCP (DCTCP): TCP Congestion Control for Data Centers

Abstract

   This Informational RFC describes Data Center TCP (DCTCP): a TCP
   congestion control scheme for data-center traffic.  DCTCP extends the
   Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) processing to estimate the
   fraction of bytes that encounter congestion rather than simply
   detecting that some congestion has occurred.  DCTCP then scales the
   TCP congestion window based on this estimate.  This method achieves
   high-burst tolerance, low latency, and high throughput with shallow-
   buffered switches.  This memo also discusses deployment issues
   related to the coexistence of DCTCP and conventional TCP, discusses
   the lack of a negotiating mechanism between sender and receiver,
