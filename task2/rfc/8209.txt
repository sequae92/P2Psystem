               A Profile for BGPsec Router Certificates,
        Certificate Revocation Lists, and Certification Requests

Abstract

   This document defines a standard profile for X.509 certificates used
   to enable validation of Autonomous System (AS) paths in the Border
   Gateway Protocol (BGP), as part of an extension to that protocol
   known as BGPsec.  BGP is the standard for inter-domain routing in the
   Internet; it is the "glue" that holds the Internet together.  BGPsec
   is being developed as one component of a solution that addresses the
   requirement to provide security for BGP.  The goal of BGPsec is to
   provide full AS path validation based on the use of strong
   cryptographic primitives.  The end entity (EE) certificates specified
   by this profile are issued to routers within an AS.  Each of these
   certificates is issued under a Resource Public Key Infrastructure
   (RPKI) Certi
