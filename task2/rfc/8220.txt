                  Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM)
                over Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)

Abstract

   This document describes the procedures and recommendations for
   Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Provider Edges (PEs) to facilitate
   replication of multicast traffic to only certain ports (behind which
   there are interested Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) routers
   and/or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) hosts) via PIM
   snooping and proxying.

   With PIM snooping, PEs passively listen to certain PIM control
   messages to build control and forwarding states while transparently
   flooding those messages.  With PIM proxying, PEs do not flood PIM
   Join/Prune messages but only generate their own and send them out of
